depends 'apt', '~> 4.0'
The ~> syntax, called the pessimistic version constraint, 
tells Chef that we want the latest version of the apt cookbook that is greater than or equal to 4.0 but less than 5.0.

You could add code to your cookbook that runs apt-get update every time chef-client runs on your node. But writing a cookbook is an iterative process. You'll run it multiple times as you experiment, add features, fix problems, and so on. You don't necessarily want to update the apt cache every time you run your cookbook because the process can take some time to complete.

That's where the apt cookbook on Chef Supermarket comes in. 
The apt cookbook updates the apt cache only on the first run, and every 24 hours thereafter. You can modify these defaults if you need to.

Let's log in to the instance and verify that the apt cache was updated. When the apt cache is updated, the system updates the timestamp on the file
/var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp.
